# 🧰 Tool Usage Log – Free Consciousness Drop 01

This file logs decisions on when to use Terminal vs VS Code, to assist in skill development, mastery, and conscious tool alignment.

---

## 📅 2025-07-26

### ✅ Used: Terminal
- Created directories via `mkdir -p`
- Wrote files using `nano` and `cat <<EOF`
- Set permissions with `chmod +x`
- Linked UCAN token with `ln -s`
- Logged delegation with `nano delegation_log.csv`
- Verified symbolic DID mirror folder
- Executed full CID scaffold using manual bash input
- Resolved file permission issues manually

### 🧪 Used: VS Code
- Opened full Drop 01 folder for browsing
- Inspected `manifest_whisper_drop.md` layout visually
- Confirmed file structure and GitLens activation
- **Why?**: Markdown and JSON manifest readability with colorized syntax
- **Tool still secondary** — terminal remains default ritual path

### 🔮 Rule

> Terminal is the spine. VS Code is the observatory.  
> Use VS Code when you need clarity, structure, or GUI-specific tasks.  
> Always return to shell for rituals, execution, and real control.

### 📅 2025-07-26 (Final Ritual Entry - Drop 01)

#### ✅ Used: Terminal
- Mirrored symbolic DID folder via `mkdir -p` + `echo` → `/did_key_z4MXj1wBzi9J/`
- Searched for UCAN credentials with `find ~ -name '*ucan*'`
- Linked active `ucan_token.txt` via `ln -s` to the Drop's delegation folder
- Created and manually logged `delegation_log.csv`
- Authored `manifest_whisper_drop.md` using `cat <<EOF`, validated via `cat` and `nano`
- Handled file permission errors and removed accidental `.md` directory using `rm -r`
- Preferred terminal over GUI even for Markdown creation and structure resolution

#### 🧪 Used: VS Code
- Opened Drop folder with:
  ```bash
  code ~/eternum-vault/whisper-drops/Free_Consciousness_Drop_01/
